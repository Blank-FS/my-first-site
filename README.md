# my-first-site

As the repo name suggests, this repo is an archive of the very first site I built and deployed when I just started out learning web dev through MDN web docs. The site is built on top of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and there is nothing much to see in terms of content. The site used to be in the repo blank-fs.github.io and deployed using github-pages there, but from now on I will be using blank-fs.github.io for my personal website. The code for my first site is uploaded here for purely nostalgic reasons.
